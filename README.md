# üíª Sherrylock - decentralized social media from Wavlo

- ü§¨ No censorship & great synchronization - great combo. You just need to find the server - there is no way that random server will modify what you say on another.
- üí¢ Join **one** server, integrate with **all others**! You doesn't need 1000 accounts - each for each server. Register on one - everyone, not important from which server will see you.

**Hey!** This is alongside project. Maybe you want to take look at Wavlo in [our official Discord server](https://discord.gg/PuCxk5PnzU).

## ‚ùì FAQ

1. Why not Node.JS/React/Next.JS and other shit?
  - First answer: because I know PHP better, I don't understand this and I think this is shit. Second answer: because no
2. How to run this?
  - Just download Apache or its random distribution (like XAMPP). You can also use Ngnix, but I don't check on it - so use Apache better. Then run the server and visit `localhost`.
3. How to contribute?
  - Fork the repo, change something, submit a pull request and everything should be fine. Make sure to test these changes.
